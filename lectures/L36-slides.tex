\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Exam Instructions}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item No aids are permitted. No calculators of any type are permitted.
	\item Turn off all communication devices.
	\item There are five (5) questions, some with multiple parts. Not all are equally difficult.
	\item The exam lasts 150 minutes and there are 120 marks.
	\item If you feel like you need to ask a question, know that the most likely answer is ``Read the Question''. No questions are permitted. If you find that a question requires clarification, proceed by clearly stating any reasonable assumptions necessary to complete the question. If your assumptions are reasonable, they will be taken into account during grading.  
\end{enumerate}

(This information subject to change.)

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{How to Prepare}

How to prepare for the final exam:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Review lecture notes and slides.
	\item Review the tutorial slides.
	\item Understand your lab solutions.
	\item Try old assignments and old exams.
	\item Ask for extra help if you need it (we have many TAs + 2 instructors).
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Exam Tips}

Tips for the Exam:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Take the time to read the question carefully.
	\item You can use point form instead of full sentences.
	\item Don't leave questions blank - Nothing on the page = 0 marks.
	\item Do the questions you know (or find easy) first, then move on to more challenging ones.
	\item Keep an eye on the time.
	\item Sleep the night before (all nighters are bad).
	
\end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{About Grades}

No grades can be released until after the end of exams.

You'll see them in Quest when grades for the term become available.


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Tips for Work Term Reports}

You have to write work term reports in the upcoming co-op term.

A subject I know lots about...\\
\quad I wrote 4 reports.
\quad I also marked about 100 of them.

Some basic tips will help you avoid the dreaded resubmission.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Work Report Tips}

Spelling, grammar and formatting count as well.\\
	\quad You can ask someone to proofread, but acknowledge their help.
	
Follow the checklist (Appendix C in the guidelines).

The Contributions section is boring to write, but it's mandatory.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Work Report Tips}

You need technical content. This also means you need numbers.\\
	\quad Describing things in qualitative terms is not enough.

Figures and tables are valuable tools.\\
	\quad ``A picture is worth a thousand words''.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{\#1 Reason Why Work Reports Fail}

They look like documentation or story-telling.\\
	\quad Documentation: Clicking the ``report'' button produces a CSV file...\\
	\quad Storytelling: First we did $x$, then we did $y$, and then...

The key question: is there a decision in this report?\\
	\quad No decision-making means a failing grade.
	
You can use a Computational Decision-Making Chart in your report.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The End}

That's all for ECE~155. Thanks for a great term!

I wish you success on the exam.
